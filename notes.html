  <h2>Lab 2:2 HTML Knowledge</h2>  
    <p>HTML tags are hidden keywords in a webpage. Examples are:  &lt;html&gt;, &lt;title&gt;, and &lt;body&gt;.</p>
    <p>An empty tag is a tag that is not closed with a slash character. A regular tag contains the opening tag, content, and closing tag.</p>
    <p>An HTML tag attribute comes in name/value pairs and provides additional information about HTML elements.</p>
    <p>To nest an HTML tag, you would have to close the tag that was opened recently.</p>
    <p>In order to add the id attribute, you would have to choose an HTML element that is unique.</p>
    <p>To add a class to an HTML tag, you would have to add &lt;div&gt; elements to each HTML class of your choice.</p>
    <p>An ID is for one unique element, while the class attribute can be used for multiple elements.</p>
    <p>A type selector selects all elements of the given type on a page.</p>
    <p>The head tag contains information in the head portion of a document. Some examples are: &lt;meta&gt;, &lt;title&gt;, and &lt;style&gt;.</p>
    <p>The body tag lists the document's body. Some examples are text, images, and links.</p>
