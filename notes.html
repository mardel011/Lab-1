                        HTML tags which are similar to keywords can help a web browser structure content on the web browser. HTML tags contain three parts: the opening tag, content, and closing tag.

            <h2>Lab 2:2 HTML Knowledge</h2>
            <p>HTML tags are hidden keywords in a webpage. Examples are:  &lt;html&gt;, &lt;title&gt;, and &lt;body&gt;.</p>
            <p>An empty tag is a tag that is not closed with a slash character. A regular tag contains the opening tag, content, and closing tag.</p>
            <p>An HTML tag attribute comes in name/value pairs and provides additional information about HTML elements.</p>
            <p>To nest an HTML tag, you would have to close the tag that was opened recently.</p>
            <p>In order to add the id attribute, you would have to choose an HTML element that is unique.</p>
            <p>To add a class to an HTML tag, you would have to add &lt;div&gt; elements to each HTML class of your choice.</p>
            <p>An ID is for one unique element, while the class attribute can be used for multiple elements.</p>
            <p>A type selector selects all elements of the given type on a page.</p>
            <p>The head tag contains information in the head portion of a document. Some examples are: &lt;meta&gt;, &lt;title&gt;, and &lt;style&gt;.</p>
            <p>The body tag lists the document's body. Some examples are text, images, and links.</p>

            <h4>Lab 3</h4>
            <p>How to calculate the height and width:<p>
            <p>"The total width of an element should be calculated like this:<p>
            <p>Total element width = width + left padding + right padding + left border + right border + left margin + right margin.<p>
            <p>The total height of an element should be calculated like this:<p>
            <p>Total element height = height + top padding + bottom padding + top border + bottom border + top margin + bottom margin."<p>
            <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp">CSS Box Model Reference</a></p>
            <p>The total height is 265 (250+4+2+1+1+5+2) and the total width is 418 (400+3+3+1+1+7+3). The height and width of the content area is width 392 (400-3-3-1-1) and height 242 (250-4-2-1-1).</p>

                The college was established during the formation of Ontario's community college system in 1967. Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology were established on May 21, 1965. The college is named after George Brown, who was an important 19th century politician and newspaper publisher (he founded the Toronto Globe, forerunner to The Globe and Mail) and was one of the Fathers of Confederation.

                The college's predecessor, the Provincial Institute of Trades (PIT), was founded in 1951 to offer apprentice training on behalf of the provincial Department of Labour. In 1952, began operation at 21 Nassau Street in Toronto's Kensington Market and, after expanding with the construction of two additional buildings on the site, was offering programs in lathing and structural steel, barbering, diesel mechanics, jewellery arts, watchmaking and welding by 1961. In 1962 the province opened The Provincial Institute of Trades and Occupations (PITO), a sister training institute, at 555 Davenport Road near Casa Loma.
