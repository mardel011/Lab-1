<p>I have a degree in Criminology and History and I have over 10 years of work experience in the retail and telecommunications industries. I'm interested in learning new tools and skills in web development that will be beneficial for working in the blockchain field. I'm particularly interested in learning more about smart contracts to see how blockchain technology challenges traditional ways of regulating contracts. After this course, I would like to continue learning more by creating hands-on opportunities to keep myself constantly engaged.</p>
